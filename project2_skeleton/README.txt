1. How to identify the locality of the input files?

For test cases in "data" directory, you can easily figure the locality by the file name.

For example, "10^5/L5data.txt" means the L5data.txt contains 10^5 data and the locality is 5.

2. What is runAll.sh?

runAll.sh is a bash script that automatically runs all of your sorting algorithms and produce the output in a file called runtimes.txt.

***IMPORTANT*** Please read the runAll.sh
